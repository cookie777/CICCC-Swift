/*:
 Allowing `stroke` to be of type `String` isn't very type-safe. Inside the `SwimmingWorkout` struct, create an enum called `Stroke` that has cases for `freestyle`, `butterfly`, `backstroke`, and `breaststroke`. Change the type of `stroke` from `String` to `Stroke`. Create two instances of `SwimmingWorkout` objects.

/*:
 Now imagine you want to log swimming workouts separately based on the swimming stroke. You might use arrays as static variables on `SwimmingWorkout` for this. Add four static variables, `freestyleWorkouts`, `butterflyWorkouts`, `backstrokeWorkouts`, and `breaststrokeWorkouts`, to `SwimmingWorkout` above. Each should be of type `[SwimmingWorkout]` and should default to empty arrays.
 */

/*:
 Now add an instance method to `SwimmingWorkout` called `save()` that takes no parameters and has no return value. This method will add its instance to the static array on `SwimmingWorkout` that corresponds to its swimming stroke. Inside `save()` write a switch statement that switches on the instance's `stroke` property, and appends `self` to the proper array. Call save on the two instances of `SwimmingWorkout` that you created above, and then print the array(s) to which they should have been added to see if your `save` method works properly.
